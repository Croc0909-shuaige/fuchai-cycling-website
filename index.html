    <p>
      Hello! My name is <strong>Fu Chai</strong>, and I’m passionate about <em>cycling</em>.  
      For me, it's much more than just a sport; it's a way to explore the world, clear my mind, and challenge myself physically and mentally.  
      Every ride is a new adventure that connects me with nature and reminds me of the importance of perseverance, patience, and focus. 
      When I’m on my bike, I feel free and connected, completely in the moment.
      <br><br>
      I first started cycling as a simple way to stay active, but it quickly became one of my greatest joys and passions.  
      The feeling of the wind rushing past my face, the steady rhythm of pedaling, and the sound of tires gliding over the road combine to create a sense of peace and energy.  
      On my rides, I often pass tall swaying trees, calm lakes reflecting the sky, and colorful open fields. 
      I especially love catching the sunrise at the start of a ride and the sunset on my way home. 
      It's a romantic way to say hello to and goodbye to the day.
      <br><br>
      Through cycling, I’ve learned to push my limits, appreciate the journey as much as the destination, and find joy in every climb and descent. 
      Each ride leaves me with a deep sense of accomplishment and gratitude for the world around me.
