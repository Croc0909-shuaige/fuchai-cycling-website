    <p>
      Hello! My name is <strong>Fu Chai</strong>, and I’m passionate about <em>cycling</em>.  
      For me, cycling is much more than just a sport—it’s a way to explore the world, clear my mind, and challenge myself physically and mentally.  
      Every ride is a new adventure that brings me closer to nature and reminds me of the value of perseverance and focus.
      <br><br>
      I first started cycling as a way to stay active, but it quickly became one of my greatest joys.  
      The feeling of the wind on my face, the sound of the tires on the road, and the thrill of a new route are experiences that never get old.  
      Through cycling, I’ve learned patience, endurance, and the beauty of staying present in every moment.  
      This website is a small glimpse into my journey—how cycling has shaped me, what I’ve learned along the way, and why I continue to ride.  
      I hope it inspires you to find something that moves you—both physically and emotionally.
