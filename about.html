    <h2>The Beauty of the Ride</h2>

    <p>
      Cycling gives me a sense of freedom that few other things can match.  
      It’s a balance between effort and peace—a rhythm that clears the mind and strengthens the body.  
      I love the quiet roads lined with trees, the hum of the wheels, and the way the world looks different from the saddle of a bike.  
      <br><br>
      Each journey brings new lessons—about persistence, appreciation for the outdoors, and the joy of simply being in motion.  
      Whether I’m climbing steep hills or coasting down long descents, cycling keeps me grounded, healthy, and motivated.
